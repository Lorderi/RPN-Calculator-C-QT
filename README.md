Program RPN_calculator:

- C11 standard C
- Makefile with the standard set of targets for GNU programs: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, test, gcov_report.
- Structured programming
- Google Style
- Unit-test coverage of modules related to expression evaluation (check.h)
- Implementation with graphical user interface (Qt)
- Both integers and real numbers written with a dot as inputs.
- Calculation of bracketed arithmetic expressions, and with substitution of the _x_ variable value as a number.
- Plotting a function (QCustomPlot.h), with the _x_ variable.
- Verifiable fractional precision - 7 decimal places
- Stapled arithmetic expressions support arithmetic operations and math functions:
    - *Arithmetic operators: \
        Parentheses: (a + b) \
        Subtraction: a - b \
        Addition: a + b \
        Division: a / b \
        Multiplication: a * b \
        Remainder of division: a mod b \
        Increasing to a degree: a ^ b \
        Percentage calculation: a % \
        Change sign: a +/-
